## Project Overview

This project designs a database to track the progress of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA), which aims to address unemployment and its related societal issues in India.

## Objectives

- **Showcase Seasonal Job Data**: Display seasonal job data by state and highlight employment ratios.

- **Bank Account Data**: Facilitate the transition to UPI for scheduled castes and tribes.
- **Reduce Paperwork**: Simplify data retrieval for analysis.

## Components

### ER Diagram

- **Triggers**: Log person entries.
- **User-Defined Functions**: Calculate average job experience.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Secure sensitive data (e.g., UPI ID).
- **Views**: Simplify data access and aggregation (e.g., caste with max jobs, government expenditure, salary clearance).
